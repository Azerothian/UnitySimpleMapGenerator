This is a port of Baran Kahyaoglu's Simple Map Generator, which you can find
here:

The Simple Map Generator is based on an article and some code by Amit Patel:

http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/

This port brings the Simple Map Generator code into Unity3D and produces a
3D mesh suitable for characters to walk around on.
