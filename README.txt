Source Origins:

The Simple Map Generator is based on an article and some code by Amit Patel:

http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/

Baran's code makes use of Fortune's Voronoi code by BenDi on CodeProject:

Unity3D Port:

This port brings the Simple Map Generator code into Unity3D and produces a
3D mesh suitable for characters to walk around on.
